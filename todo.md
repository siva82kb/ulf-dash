# TODO File for UL Functioing Dashboard


### arimulib.py
- [ ] Interploating ARIMU only for short time segments. Leave large segments unfilled.


### bookeeping.py
- [ ] Add table with the start and end times of files that have already been analysed. This will avoid the need for reading the files every time data processing is to be done. (2023-02-06 14:39:05)
- [ ] **BookKeeper._filter_out_duplicate_timestamp_files** - We might need a more sophisticated approach to deciding  which ones to keep. (2022-10-06 08:02:48)
